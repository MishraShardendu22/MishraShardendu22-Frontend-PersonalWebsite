## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Performance Detection
```typescript
const isLowEnd = () => {
  // Check reduced motion preference
  if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches) return true
  
  // Check connection speed
  if (connection.effectiveType === 'slow-2g' || connection.effectiveType === '2g') return true
  
  // Check memory
  if (navigator.deviceMemory < 4) return true
  
  // Check CPU performance
  const start = performance.now()
  // ... performance test
  return (end - start) > 50
}
```

### Adaptive Rendering
```typescript
const getPerformanceSettings = () => {
  if (isLowEnd) {
    return {
      animationFrameRate: 30,
      particleCount: 100,
      blurEffects: false,
      complexShadows: false
    }
  }
  
  return {
